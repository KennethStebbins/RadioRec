- [ ] Write unit tests for new RadioStream and RadioStream-related functionality
- [ ] Write PersistentByteBuffer that writes data on append
- [ ] Modify RadioStream and RedundantRadioStream to allow you to give them byte buffers on init
- [ ] Modify RadioStreamManager to select the stream with the largest buffer when failing over
- [ ] Add locks back to helper methods in ByteBuffer
- [x] Write unit tests for new ByteBuffer functionality
- [x] Refactor ByteBuffer to use private variables properly and expose some as properties
    - Things that should be properties:
        - `byte_array` (ro)
        - `length` (ro)
        - `readable_length` (ro)
- [x] Finish syncing mechanic in Redundant Radio Stream
- [x] Refactor ByteBuffer to have the proper prefix on private methods (one `_` instead of two `__`)

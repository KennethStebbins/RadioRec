- [ ] Finish syncing mechanic in Redundant Radio Stream
- [ ] Refactor ByteBuffer to use private variables properly and expose some as properties
    - Things that should be properties:
        - `byte_array` (ro)
        - `write_lock` (ro)
        - `consume_lock` (ro)
        - `length` (ro)
        - `readable_length` (ro)
- [ ] Refactor ByteBuffer to have the proper prefix on private methods (one `_` instead of two `__`)
- [ ] Write unit tests for new ByteBuffer functionality
- [ ] Write unit tests for new RadioStream and RadioStream-related functionality
- [ ] Write PersistentByteBuffer that writes data on append
- [ ] Modify RadioStream and RedundantRadioStream to allow you to give them byte buffers on init
